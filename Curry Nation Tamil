Coconut Paste: In the same pan, dry roast the grated coconut until it turns golden brown. Once cooled, grind it into a smooth paste by adding a little water. Keep it aside.
Cook the Base: Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or kadai. Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the raw smell disappears. Next, add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil begins to separate from the mixture.
Add Chicken and Spices: Add the cleaned chicken pieces to the pot. Stir in the turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and the freshly ground spice mix. Mix everything well so the chicken is coated with all the spices.
Simmer the Curry: Pour enough water into the pot to cover the chicken. Add salt to taste. Cover and cook on medium heat until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. This should take around 20-25 minutes.
Coconut and Final Touches: Once the chicken is cooked, add the roasted coconut paste and curry leaves to the pot. Stir everything well and let it simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine beautifully.
Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat and garnish the Chettinad Chicken Curry with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with steamed rice, dosa, or parotta for an authentic Tamil Nadu meal experience.
Tips for the Perfect Chettinad Curry:
Always roast the spices on low heat to prevent them from burning and to bring out their full flavors.
Freshly ground spices make all the difference in this recipe, so avoid using pre-ground spices if possible.
Coconut is a key ingredient in Tamil Nadu cuisine, adding richness and balancing the heat of the spices.
